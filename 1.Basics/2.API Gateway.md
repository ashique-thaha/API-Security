Legacy Monolithic applications are now switching to micro-services.They are loosely coupled to make our application scalable.This will eventually result in having more API calls b/w clients and these micro-services. So there must be a way to manage these traffic. There comes API Gateway, this will be a great solution to this issue.

We can can consider API Gateway as a reverse proxy or maybe an API traffic controller. It will receive all API requests from client and pass it to appropriate micro-service.

It will help in security posture by regulations and filtering instead of keeping the network wide open. The gateway will act as a barrier between client and internal network.

It will help in protocol translation as, https traffic can be decrypted to http in the Gateway itself and then forwarded to internal network.This will improve performance drastically.

Suppose there is spike in traffic on a special occasion on an e-commerce site. API Gateway can be helpful here by added one dedicated API Gateway for each user agent like mobile device, desktop etc. This will help in load balancing.

Benefits of API Gateway:
- Latency improvement
- Better user experience
- Avoids unwanted traffic
- Improves security posture
- Helps in Protocol translation
