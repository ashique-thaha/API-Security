Imagine there is an e-commerce store, where REST API is used but a new developer doesn't know REST API so, instead of looking at complex code base, he can look into something called OPEN API definition to understand what the REST API does here.


**The openAPI specification:** It defines how to describe a REST API interface.
**OpenAPI Definition:** This is actually a file, that's typically YAML or JSON.It describes what an API or service can do.

With openAPI definition we can describe:
- REST API's resources
- Properties or Data types
- Endpoints, operations, parameters and REST API's authentication or authorisation



Benefits:
- Standardised format for describing REST API.

- Readable by machines and humans alike.

- Will allow to extend Rest API with tooling. 
	
	- one example is an API validator(this will take openAPI definition and run through some validations to ensure that the REST API actually confirms to a certain set of industry standard, because not all APIs are made equal). 
	
	- There is also an API doc generator which will take in that open API definition and generate REST API documentation or reference that is interactive and it describes very clearly what exactly this REST API does.
	
	- Another example of tooling is an SDK generator, which will once again take in the openAPI definition and the output will be client libraries in a programming language of your choice.
