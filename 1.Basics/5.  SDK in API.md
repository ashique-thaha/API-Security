We know what an API is(REST API specifically in this case), 
- it will help us by abstracting  the complexity of the code
- help in communication b/w different services
- deals with CRUD operations
- finally there will be an endpoint to call the API

So how as a developer we add API to our code? There comes SDK, here we don't have to worry about setting all these building blocks of API.

SDK stands for software development kit. we can consider SDK as a tool box of tools or code that actually calls API for us.

SO almost all programming languages have SDKs, let's assume SDK as something that sits inside the application and without manually setting up each block by just calling a function on that programming language.

This is a java SDK calling function for a visual recognition app:
```java
AnalyzeResponse response = visualRecognition
   .analyze ("cat.jpeg").getResult() ;
label.setText(response.name);
```

In this case in JAVA, the response will be in a native object model in JAVA called, "Analyse Response Object".
