## How does it happen?

Broken Function Level Authorisation reflects a scenario where a low privileged user (e.g., sales) bypasses system checks and gets access to **confidential data by impersonating a high privileged user (Admin)**. 

Consider a scenario of complex access control policies with various hierarchies, roles, and groups and a vague separation between regular and administrative functions leading to severe authorisation flaws. 

By taking advantage of these issues, the intruders can easily access the unauthorised resources of another user or, most dangerously – the administrative functions.   

Broken Function Level Authorisation reflects IDOR permission, where a user, most probably an intruder, can perform administrative-level tasks. APIs with complex user roles and permissions that can span the hierarchy are more prone to this attack. 

  
## Likely Impact

The attack primarily targets the authorisation and non-repudiation principles of security. Broken Functional Level Authorisation can lead an intruder to impersonate an authorised user and let the malicious actor get administrative rights to perform sensitive tasks.
